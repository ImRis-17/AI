                <p><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. It enables machines to learn, reason, problem-solve, and make decisions. AI systems rely on large datasets, algorithms, and computational power to function effectively. The concept of AI has been around since the mid-20th century, but significant advancements have occurred in recent decades due to increased processing power and data availability. AI is used in various fields, including healthcare, finance, robotics, and entertainment, improving efficiency and innovation.</p>
